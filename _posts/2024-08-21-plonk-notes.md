# Intro

Here is a set of notes I took for videos and articles from [David](https://x.com/cryptodavidw):

- [Plonk video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJMt6zV1c7Gh9Utg-Vng2V6EYVidTFCC&si=X7i_Bzq-Y94k-wCO)
- ["Understanding Plonk" article](https://www.cryptologie.net/article/527/understanding-plonk/)
- ["Plonk's permutation, the definitive explanation" article](https://www.cryptologie.net/article/610/plonks-permutation-the-definitive-explanation/)

Also added a bunch of my own thoughts. Hope it is helpful! (Notes were taken in notion for easier LaTex and screenshots)

It covers how Plonk works in general and the idea behind permutation proof. More details and Plonk optimizations will be discussed in wave 2 notes, stay tuned.
